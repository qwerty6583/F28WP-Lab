Week 3 Lab Report:
Implementation of the gallery slideshow was done in the same way as it was demonstrated live during the lab session, so no particular challenges were present. Despite high similarity between lab session code and this code, the code was studied and fully understood by me.

Implementation of the form validation page used the same idea from the lab session, the only challenge was writing the js code, but css code provided all the hints needed (such as using classes "error" and "success" and adding/removing them from the elements to display validation).
